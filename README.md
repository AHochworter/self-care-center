### Context:

The "Self Care Center" was an individual project assigned during the third week of Module 1 at Turing School of Software and Design. With a five-day timeline, the primary objective was to gain practical experience in developing an application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Notably, this was our first "blank slate" assignment, where only the essential "boilerplate" code was provided in the HTML file. Accompanied by images of a comp for reference, the project aimed to challenge us to recreate the interface. The app we built enables users to select between affirmations and mantras, providing them with positive messages tailored to their preference and fostering a sense of self-care and mindfulness.
